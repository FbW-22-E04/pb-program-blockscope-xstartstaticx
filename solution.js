/**
 * One reason to use if / else statements instead of the ternary operators is when you would like to have more than two outcomes such as when you are writing an else if within your if /else statement. If you find yourself needing to check more than one condition, the if / else statement with else if inside of it is more than likely the way to go.

One great time to use the ternary operator instead of the if / else statement is whenever you would otherwise use a simple if / else statement. Anything that can fit in a single line of code is a great time to use the ternary operator because itâ€™s much more compact and easy to read. Ternary operators are also great for when you want to set a value to a given variable.
